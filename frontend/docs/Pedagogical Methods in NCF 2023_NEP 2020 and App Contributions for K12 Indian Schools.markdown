# Pedagogical Methods in NCF 2023/NEP 2020 and App Contributions for K12 Indian Schools

## Purpose
This documentation lists the pedagogical methods prescribed by the **National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2023** and **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020** for K12 education in Indian schools. It also explains how your app, designed to generate school documents like Lesson Plans, Timetables, Attendance Registers, School ID Cards, Leaving Certificates, and Bonafide Certificates, can support these methods. The focus is on aligning app features with NCF’s vision of holistic, competency-based, and inclusive education across the 5+3+3+4 curricular stages.
