## Customization Options for Your App
To ensure your app supports diverse Indian schools, include the following customizable features:

   - Integrate with school management systems (e.g., Teachmint, PowerSchool) via API for real-time data sync.

4. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR/CCPA for handling sensitive student data.
   - Implement role-based access (e.g., principal, admin) to restrict certificate generation.
   - Maintain audit logs for tracking certificate issuance or modifications.
   - Auto-generate unique certificate numbers to prevent duplication.

5. **Output Options**:

3. **Customization**: Configures fields, colors, signatures, and branding elements.
