## Customization Options for Your App
To ensure your app supports diverse Indian schools, include the following customizable features:

1. **Template Design**:
   - Allow schools to upload their logo and official seal for header/footer.
   - Provide options to customize colors, fonts, and borders to align with school branding.
   - Offer pre-designed templates (e.g., formal, modern, minimalistic) for quick setup.
   - Support real-time preview of certificate design.

2. **Field Customization**:
   - Enable toggling of fields (e.g., Mother’s Name, Purpose) based on school or board requirements.
   - Support multilingual text (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, or other regional languages) for school name or verification statement.
   - Allow custom fields (e.g., “Enrollment Date” or “Student Category” for reserved categories like SC/ST) for specific school needs.

3. **Data Input Options**:
   - Support bulk upload via CSV/Excel for student data (name, admission number, class, etc.).
   - Provide manual entry for small schools or individual certificates.
   - Integrate with school management systems (e.g., Teachmint, PowerSchool) via API for real-time data sync.

4. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Ensure compliance with GDPR/CCPA for handling sensitive student data.
   - Implement role-based access (e.g., principal, admin) to restrict certificate generation.
   - Maintain audit logs for tracking certificate issuance or modifications.
   - Auto-generate unique certificate numbers to prevent duplication.
   - Include QR code generation for digital verification of authenticity.

5. **Output Options**:

8. **Additional Features**:
   - Support templates for related certificates (e.g., provisional bonafide certificate for temporary use).
   - Offer secure archival of issued certificates within the app.
   - Enable batch generation for multiple students (e.g., for scholarship applications).

## Additional Considerations
- **Cultural Context**: Indian schools often require fields like Father’s Name and Board Affiliation for official verification. Make optional fields like Mother’s Name to respect privacy concerns.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the app can handle bulk certificate generation for large schools (e.g., 1000+ students).
- **Accessibility**: Provide high-contrast PDFs and screen-reader-compatible digital certificates.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Offer free templates or low-cost customization for budget-conscious schools.
- **Frequency**: Bonafide Certificates are issued as needed, often multiple times per student for different purposes (e.g., exams, scholarships).

## Example App Workflow
1. **Admin Access**: School admin logs into the app and selects the Bonafide Certificate module.
2. **Data Import**: Uploads student data via CSV or syncs with school management system.
3. **Customization**: Configures fields, colors, signatures, and branding elements.
4. **Preview**: Reviews the certificate in real-time within the app.
