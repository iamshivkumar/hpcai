Yes, you're absolutely right ‚Äî **when creating HPC (Holistic Progress Card) based on PARAKH**, the **activities are primarily rooted in formative assessment**.

### ‚úÖ Why Activities in HPC are Formative:

**PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development)** under **NEP 2020** promotes:

* Continuous, competency-based assessments
* Qualitative, descriptive feedback
* Tracking progress over time
* Use of **activities, observations, and reflections**
* Student self and peer assessments

All of these align strongly with **formative assessment principles**, because they:

| Feature                     | Description in PARAKH/HPC Context                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ongoing Evaluation**      | Regular activities mapped to learning outcomes and competencies |
| **Holistic View**           | Focus on cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical development   |
| **Feedback Oriented**       | Teachers give qualitative insights; students reflect            |
| **Multi-Source Inputs**     | Peer, self, teacher observations                                |
| **Contextual and Flexible** | Localized, activity-based assessments                           |

### üß© Examples of Formative Activities for HPC:

| Domain             | Activity Example                             | Assessment Mode          |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Cognitive (Math)   | Group puzzle-solving or math game            | Teacher observation      |
| Socio-emotional    | Role play to resolve a conflict              | Peer and teacher notes   |
| Language           | Story retelling with visuals                 | Rubric-based reflection  |
| Art/Music          | Drawing what they learned in a science topic | Self and peer review     |
| Physical Education | Group relay races with strategy discussion   | Video reflection + notes |

### üîÅ Summative Still Exists ‚Äî But HPC Emphasizes Formative

While **summative assessments** (like term-end tests) still play a role for reporting or benchmarking, **HPC under PARAKH** places the spotlight on **formative, day-to-day, meaningful activities** to show real learning progress.

Would you like a template for structuring an HPC entry from a formative activity (e.g., how it links to competencies, outcomes, reflections, etc.)?
