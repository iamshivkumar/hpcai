# Dynamic Form Feature for School Management Software

## Overview
The Dynamic Form Feature enables administrators, teachers, parents, and students to create and submit forms within a school management system. It supports a variety of form field types to collect data such as student information, schedules, assessments, and feedback. This feature is designed to be flexible, secure, and user-friendly, with administrative controls to ensure data consistency and compliance with educational standards (e.g., FERPA, GDPR).

This README provides an overview of supported form field types, administrative tasks, and setup instructions for developers and administrators.

## Features
- **Dynamic Form Creation**: Build custom forms with a variety of field types using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Data Validation**: Enforce rules for input formats, required fields, and conditional logic.
- **Database Integration**: Seamlessly link form submissions to student, teacher, or course records.
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for creating, editing, and viewing forms.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for accessibility on desktops and mobile devices.
- **Security**: Encrypted storage, audit trails, and compliance with data privacy regulations.

23. **Autocomplete**: Suggest values as users type (e.g., course codes).
24. **Rich Text**: Formatted text input (e.g., assignment instructions).
25. **Signature**: Digital signature capture (e.g., permission slips).
26. **Address**: Structured address input (e.g., street, city, ZIP).
27. **Currency**: Monetary input (e.g., school fees).
28. **Image**: Image upload with preview (e.g., student ID photo).
29. **Rating**: Star or numeric rating (e.g., teacher evaluation).
30. **Table**: Grid-based data entry (e.g., attendance records).
31. **Dependent Fields**: Fields that appear based on other inputs (e.g., allergies if medical condition is "Yes").

## Administrative Tasks
Certain field types and the overall feature require administrative setup and maintenance to ensure functionality, security, and data integrity. Below are the key administrative tasks:

### Field-Specific Tasks
- **Single-Choice, Multiple-Choice**: Maintain lists of options (e.g., grade levels, subjects) and update them annually or as needed.
- **Array**: Define templates for repeatable fields (e.g., emergency contact fields) and set min/max entry limits.
- **Rubric**: Create and standardize assessment templates (e.g., grading criteria).
- **Email**: Validate domains (e.g., restrict to school emails) and ensure uniqueness.
- **Phone/Tel**: Define valid number formats (e.g., country codes) and integrate with SMS services if needed.
- **Password**: Enforce security policies (e.g., minimum length) and manage reset workflows.
- **File, Image**: Set restrictions (e.g., file types, size limits), manage storage, and ensure security (e.g., virus scanning).
- **Boolean**: Clarify labels and link to workflows (e.g., approval processes).
- **Search, Autocomplete**: Sync with up-to-date datasets (e.g., student or course lists).
- **Rich Text**: Sanitize inputs to prevent malicious code (e.g., XSS attacks).
- **Signature**: Validate and securely store digital signatures, ensuring legal compliance.
- **Address**: Configure formats and integrate with validation APIs (e.g., Google Maps).
- **Currency**: Set supported currencies and integrate with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe).
- **Rating**: Define scales (e.g., 1â€“5 stars) and reporting rules.
- **Table**: Design templates and validation for structured data.
- **Dependent Fields**: Configure and test conditional logic rules.

### General Administrative Tasks
- **Form Templates**: Create and maintain reusable templates for common forms (e.g., enrollment, discipline).
- **Access Control**: Define role-based permissions (e.g., admins create forms, teachers view submissions).
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., FERPA, GDPR) through encryption and audit logs.
- **Database Integration**: Map form fields to database columns and enable real-time syncing.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports from form data (e.g., attendance trends, survey results).
- **User Training**: Provide guides or tutorials for form creation and submission.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update field options, validation rules, and integrations to align with school needs.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- **Backend**: A server with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing form data.
- **Frontend**: A web framework (e.g., React, Angular) for the form builder and user interface.
- **APIs**: Optional integrations for address validation (e.g., Google Maps), payments (e.g., Stripe), or e-signatures.
- **Security**: SSL/TLS for encrypted data transmission and storage.

### Installation

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install  # For frontend (e.g., React, Tailwind CSS)
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For backend (e.g., Django, Flask)
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file with database credentials, API keys, and storage settings.
   - Example:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/school_db
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key
     STRIPE_API_KEY=your_key
     ```

4. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate  # For Django, or equivalent for other frameworks
   ```

   ```bash
   npm start  # Frontend
   python manage.py runserver  # Backend
   ```

6. **Access the Form Builder**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/forms` to create and manage forms.

### Customization
- **Field Types**: Extend the `FormField` model to add custom field types.
- **Validation**: Add custom rules in the backend (e.g., regex for phone numbers).
- **UI**: Modify the frontend to match school branding using CSS or Tailwind.

## Usage
1. **Create a Form**:
   - Log in as an admin and access the form builder.
   - Drag and drop field types, configure options, and set validation rules.
   - Save the form as a template for reuse.

2. **Share a Form**:
   - Assign the form to users (e.g., teachers, parents) via email or portal access.
   - Set permissions for viewing or editing submissions.

3. **Submit a Form**:
   - Users fill out forms via the web or mobile interface.
   - Submissions are validated and stored in the database.

4. **View Reports**:
