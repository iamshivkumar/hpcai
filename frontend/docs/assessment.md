To design a dynamic form feature for **assessment, practice, and quiz tests** within school management software, you need a variety of question types to cater to different educational needs, such as evaluating knowledge, critical thinking, and practical skills. These question types should align with the form field types previously discussed (e.g., `text`, `number`, `single-choice`, `multiple-choice`, etc.) while being tailored for testing scenarios. Below, I provide a comprehensive list of question types suitable for assessments, practice tests, and quizzes, with descriptions and examples relevant to a school management context. I’ll also indicate how these map to the form field types you provided and consider administrative tasks for implementation.

### Administrative Tasks for Question Types
Implementing these question types in a school management system requires administrative oversight, similar to the form field tasks previously discussed. Key tasks include:

1. **Question Bank Management**:
   - Create and maintain a repository of questions and answers.
   - Categorize by subject, grade, or difficulty for reuse.
   - Example: Store multiple-choice options and correct answers for math quizzes.

2. **Answer Configuration**:
   - Define correct answers, acceptable variations, and scoring rules (e.g., partial credit for `multiple-choice`).
   - Set up auto-grading for objective types (`single-choice`, `True/False`, `numeric`) and manual grading for subjective types (`essay`, `file upload`).

3. **Rubric Design**:
   - Develop standardized rubrics for `essay`, `rubric-based`, and `file upload` questions.
   - Train teachers to apply rubrics consistently.
   - Example: A rubric for essays with criteria like Content (50%), Grammar (30%), and Structure (20%).

4. **Media Management**:
   - Upload and store images, audio, or video for `image-based`, `hotspot`, or `audio/video response` questions.
   - Ensure accessibility (e.g., alt text) and optimize file sizes.

5. **Security and Integrity**:
   - Randomize question order and options to prevent cheating.
   - Secure `File` and `audio/video` uploads with virus scanning and encryption.
   - Restrict access to question banks based on user roles (e.g., teachers vs. students).

6. **Integration with ERP**:
   - Link questions to student records and gradebooks in the ERP (e.g., OpenEduCat, ERPNext).
   - Sync submissions with reporting tools for analytics (e.g., class performance trends).

7. **User Interface**:
   - Implement interactive elements like drag-and-drop for `ordering` or `hotspot` questions.
   - Ensure mobile compatibility for students and teachers.

8. **Time and Access Controls**:
   - Set time limits for quizzes (e.g., 30 minutes for a test).
   - Configure access periods (e.g., quiz available from May 10–12, 2025).

9. **Reporting and Feedback**:
   - Generate reports on student performance (e.g., average score, question difficulty).
   - Provide feedback to students (e.g., correct answers for `multiple-choice` or comments for `essay`).

---

### Recommendations for Implementation
To integrate these question types into an open-source ERP (e.g., ERPNext, OpenEduCat, Fedena), consider the following:

1. **ERPNext (Frappe Education)**:
   - Use the low-code form builder to create question types like `single-choice`, `multiple-choice`, and `essay`.
   - Extend with custom scripts for `hotspot`, `drag-and-drop`, or `code submission` using JavaScript and Python.
   - Leverage the reporting module for performance analytics.

2. **OpenEduCat**:
   - Utilize Odoo’s quiz module for `multiple-choice`, `True/False`, and `short answer` questions.
   - Add custom modules for `rubric`, `image-based`, or `audio/video response` using Odoo Studio.
   - Integrate with LMS for practice tests.

3. **Fedena/Gibbon**:
   - Use built-in exam modules for basic types (`multiple-choice`, `essay`).
   - Install plugins for `matching`, `ordering`, or `file upload` questions.
   - Customize UI for `hotspot` or `drag-and-drop` with community support.

4. **General Tips**:
   - **Auto-Grading**: Implement for objective types (`single-choice`, `numeric`, `True/False`) using ERP database rules.
   - **Manual Grading**: Create workflows for `essay`, `file upload`, and `rubric-based` questions, assigning tasks to teachers.
   - **Question Banks**: Store questions in the ERP database, tagged by subject and grade for easy retrieval.
   - **Accessibility**: Ensure all question types are accessible (e.g., keyboard navigation for `drag-and-drop`, captions for `audio/video`).
