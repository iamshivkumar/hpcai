# Documentation for School Timetable Format for K12 Indian Schools (NCF 2023 Aligned)

## Purpose
This documentation defines the standard format for a School Timetable used by administrators and teachers in K12 Indian schools, aligned with the **National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2023** and **National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**. The timetable organizes instructional time to support holistic, competency-based, and multidisciplinary learning across the 5+3+3+4 curricular stages, ensuring compliance with Indian education board requirements (e.g., CBSE, ICSE, State Boards). It is designed for integration into a mobile or web application, providing a flexible and user-friendly tool for scheduling with customization options to meet diverse school needs.

## NCF 2023 Context for Timetables
NCF 2023 emphasizes timetables that:
- Allocate time for **core subjects** (languages, math, sciences, social sciences), **arts**, **physical education**, and **vocational education**.
- Support **play-based and activity-based learning** in the Foundational and Preparatory Stages.
- Enable **flexible subject choices** in the Secondary Stage to promote multidisciplinary learning.
- Include **co-curricular activities** (e.g., values education, environmental awareness) and **remedial/support sessions** for inclusivity.
- Integrate **Information and Communication Technology (ICT)** and project-based learning.
- Ensure **balanced workloads** for students and teachers, with adequate breaks to support well-being.
